	- **Receive a "Schein" (including ECTS) from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München:** If you enroll in any university of Bavaria and you want to receive a "Schein", please submit **an essay of your own scientific work** at the end of the course to scientificwritingmunich@gmail.com. As mentioned on card 5, you should apply the gathered knowledge of each unit on your own project or scientific work (which can also be a Bachelor´s or Master´s thesis). At the end, students should *only submit the title, abstract & result sections* as essay and not the whole of the project or publication. The students can submit their parts *on or before 15.09.* for the summer semester and **14.03.** for the winter semester. Please submit your parts in english. Please also tell us your **institution and matriculation number** in this mail.
