As mentioned on card 5, you should apply the gathered knowledge of each unit on your own project or scientific work (which can also be a Bachelor´s or Master´s thesis). At the end, students should *only submit the title, abstract & result sections* as essay and not the whole of the project or publication. The students can submit their parts *on or before 15.09.* for the summer semester and **14.03.** for the winter semester. Please submit your parts in english. Please also tell us your **institution and matriculation number** in this mail.

- Restrict your search(citeria)
    - controlling your search: 善用 boolean operator 和 well-defined term-> most essential
    - saving time: filter->reduce
    - qualify standard: deselect old publication/target publication -> minimun qualify standard

- define your search term
    - 限制 P
    - AND OR NOT
    - 空格=AND, 括号=布尔优先级, 引号=组合, \*=wildcard

- Advanced search options
    - language(指定论文语言)
    - timespan(出版时间): 通常五年
    - article type: 比如先看 secondary 来确定大概方向(因时效性, 应辅以 primary)

##### if restrict access
- 花钱
- 你的大学的图书馆
- 让你的大学花钱
- ResearchGate
- 请求作者发一份

##### publication bias
是指被发表的更多是 positive findings, 而 negative or inconclusive results
